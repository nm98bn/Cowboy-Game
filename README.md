# Cowboy-Game
This project is a work in progress. I work on it when I have time.
This is my first project I'm working on that isn't a university assignment. It is java based. I wanted to create a game that allows the player to be a cowboy, roam an area, and fight enemies.
The player is thrown into an area and has to fight various different enemies. The enemies have different health and attack damage values.
The attack values of the player and the enemies are randomly chosen whenever both attack. The player has the option of healing and running during a fight.
The enemy has a chance to drop banadges (In game healing item) for the player upon dying. 
The player starts with three bandages. 
I'm in the process of creating specific areas with specific enemies, specific weapons, and a storyline.
